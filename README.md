"Know Your Countries" uses RestCountries API to provide info on countries. Users can input a country name, filter by region, and enjoy a flag guessing mini game. 

⚠️ **Note:** The external API has changed, and I haven’t updated my code to match the new version yet. So you will be able to see the deployed site but you wont be able to use it.
